## Description:
**Learning Reliable Rewards for LLMs via RLHF: Robustness, Adaptivity and [Beyond](https://pages.beamery.com/Pinterest/page/october-pinterest-labs-talk-series-featuring-tuo-zhao-7zjueht0_z)**: Learning from human preferences is central to aligning large language models. This talk presents a three‑step progression that addresses core challenges and points toward the future of RLHF. 3 Models: Bradley–Terry–Luce (BTL), adaptive preference scaling, generative reward models (GRMs).

## Resources:
- Pinterest is focusing on LLM's:
    - **Bradley–Terry–Luce (BTL)** reward modeling, which treats corrupted or adversarial comparisons as sparse outliers, stabilizing estimation and yielding reliable rewards.
    - **Adaptive preference scaling** within the BTL family—an instance‑wise weighting that captures varying strengths of preference, providing a more faithful treatment of both ambiguous and decisive comparisons. 
    - **Generative Reward Models (GRMs)**: reward models that reason before judging by producing structured rationales and then issuing a preference signal, trained on pairwise data and used to directly optimize policies.
